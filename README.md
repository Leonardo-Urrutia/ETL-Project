# ETL-Project

We downloaded our data sources from the web. One of the csv's was too large so we had to compress the resources folder into a zip file. To prevent issues, we added the Resources folder into the .gitignore.

Starter notebook was created, importing csv's into PD DataFrames. Some initial cleaning was done to perform the first merge to allow our group to play with the data.

Ben has Amazon Prime.

Tyson has Hulu.

Buckley has Netflix.

Ryan has Disney +.

Leo and Calvin are going to clean the main DF.


We are going to do some ETL on some <strong>movies</strong>.
